# [wip] cecxx

**{cecxx}** is an implementation of IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) benchmarks in C++20. 

> [!WARNING]  
> This library is under active development. Currently, only the CEC-2017 edition is complete.
> If you want to use slightly better implementations of other editions than those proposed by the competition organizers, go to branch [legacy-c](https://github.com/ewarchul/cecxx/tree/legacy-c).
